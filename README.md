# Vision Transformer Models for Wooden Pallet Damage Classification with Regularization Techniques

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying wooden pallet damage using Vision Transformer (ViT) models to enhance quality control in logistics and warehouse operations. Traditional manual inspections are prone to errors and inefficiencies. This solution leverages deep learning to automate the detection of defects. The study explores various regularization techniques, including batch normalization and dropout, to improve classification performance. The dataset consists of images of good and damaged wooden pallets collected from multiple sources.
